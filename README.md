Welcome to Digikritterz, a digital pet simulation game that allows you to adopt and care for your pet. Make sure to pay attention to its needs, buy it the right food and toys, and earn money through a hangman 
minigame (code sourced: https://gist.github.com/SedaKunda/79e1d9ddc798aec3a366919f0c14a078). Each user has their own account saved under a username that will allow you to save your progress.
Note that each animal has food and toy preferences and will react negatively if their needs get too low! 
Have fun!!
